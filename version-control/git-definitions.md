# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
 1. Version Control is a historical timeline of a file. It allows a person to view the entire history of revisions. Revisions can be made by multiple users. It is useful because it allows a user to go back in time of a file. Also the ability to merge the revisions to creat a cohesive piece of work.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
 1. A branch is a copy of a project that can be worked on. Using a branch allows the master to remain intact. If errors occur they can be fixed.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
 1. Commits are save points in version control, because it does not save automatically. Commits should be made when changes are made. They consist of: a unique ID, a message, an author and a timestamp. A good commit message is specific.
* What is a merge conflict?
 1. Merge conflicts occur when two branches try to merge and they have both edited the same part of the same file. An editor is used to resolve the conflict.
