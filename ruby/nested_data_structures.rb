#design and build a nested data structure to represent a real-world construct. 
#You can choose the construct: 
# Build something that will use a mix of hashes and arrays.

#print a few individual pieces of deeply nested dat from the structure
#showing that you know how to use multiple indexes or hash keys (or both) 
# access nested items. Try to demonstrate a few different types of access.
