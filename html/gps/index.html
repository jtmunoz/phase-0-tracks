		<li> Semantical tags help to give the document organization. Each tag creates a container with a specific purpose. They all are pretty useful but at the moment I am fond of paragraph because it can help provide information. Headers are also pretty useful they help to provide a break in information. </li>
		<li> The browser displays items as they appear vertically. Similar to how a que works. This can be changed with CSS.</li>
		<li> This GPS I learned about creating a sublime snippet. I dont have snippet I want to create at the moment. But if I had to create one right now it would be an unordered list with three list items. I can see this being very useful for making a table or a form.</li>
		<li> There was not a concept I thought was particularly challenging. I think Christine pointed out that I should not doubt myself because I seem to know more than I realize. Well I guess overcoming my inner critic would be the challenge. I know its ok to be wrong. Especially when I have a partner that is there for support and not to knock me down. We are all in this together. So more of a personal challenge to myself.</li>
