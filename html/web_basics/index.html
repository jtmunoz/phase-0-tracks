	<h1>Hi, Welcome to Starbucks!</h1>
	<p>What can I get started for you? You sound a little <strong>tired</strong> at 4:30 am, Do you want to add an extra shot of espresso? Ok, you want two add shots. Would you like to try <em>ristretto</em> shots. They  exhibit an intense coffee flavor.
	</p>
	<p>Your shots are pulling. Your cofffe now has <ul><li>two ristretto shots</li><li>three pumps vanilla</li><li>cream</li></ul>
	</p>
	<p>Ok, so here is your drink and pastry. That will be a trillion dollars. Why so much? Lets see.
		<ol>
			<li>First you had a large coffee with 
				<ul><li>two ristretto shots</li><li>three pumps vanila</li><li>cream</li></ul>
			<li>Second you had a bistro box</li>
